chalange 3:

ai use: for challange 2 ai wase used to debug with the promt being used as: "using the criteria: " given an integer greater than 1, determine if the integer is a prime number or not", and the code: n = int(input()) while n >= 2" i = range(2, n - 1) g = n / i if n / i != 0: print(n,"is not a prime (divisible by",g,")") else: print(n,"is Prime")", the out put was the code used in the chalange 2 file
